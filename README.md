Repo also inclues source from https://github.com/nlohmann/json, which is covered under the MIT License.

Still a WIP, inspired by https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/
Building requires g++7.1 because I decided to play around with C++17

Currently can compute compression ratios for original text of cards using simplistiv LZW, will want to tweak parameters, analyze results, etc later.

Thanks to mtgjson.com for making the data for this project easily accessible.
